# facial_recognition

# This file contains two files, one for the base idea of facial recognition, and the second is for the smile detection of pictures. This uses CV2 as the base library, with the addition of the ML functions given by Haar Cascade which help with all the detections.

# All the files are attached that are necessary, and if you already have openCv then these files should already be on your device. But the convenience of having it in the file is that no path finding is needed :)
